## üß© Methodology: AI Pipeline

The project follows a **three-stage process**:

1. **Classification:**  
   A **ResNet-50** model identifies whether the X-ray is *Normal* or *Abnormal*.  

2. **Detection:**  
   If *Abnormal*, a **YOLOv8** detector localizes suspicious regions (bounding boxes).  

3. **Visualization:**  
   **Grad-CAM** overlays visualize where the model focused during prediction.
