# CliniScan: AI Lung Abnormality Detection

CliniScan is an **AI-powered system** that automatically detects and localizes lung abnormalities from chest X-ray images.  
The script uses a **deep learning model trained on the VinDr-CXR dataset** to identify findings like *opacities* and *fibrosis*, aiming to assist radiologists in their diagnostic workflow.
