## üß† About the Project

**LungScan AI** is a portfolio-level proof of concept designed to demonstrate how AI can assist in chest-X-ray screening by identifying potential lung abnormalities automatically.

**Goal:** To provide an intuitive interface for clinicians, researchers, and students to visualize how machine learning can be used for diagnostic image analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dual-Model Pipeline:** Combines classification (ResNet-based) and detection (YOLOv8) stages.  
- **Interactive Streamlit UI:** Upload an image and view both class prediction and bounding-box localization.  
- **Grad-CAM Visualization:** Highlights the key image regions influencing the model‚Äôs decision.  
- **Performance Dashboard:** Displays metrics, confusion matrices, and detected anomalies.  
- **Downloadable Reports:** Allows exporting model results and interpretations.

## üß© Methodology: AI Pipeline

The analysis follows a **three-stage sequential pipeline:**

1. **Classification:**  
   - Uses a **ResNet-50** CNN to classify each X-ray as ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù or ‚ÄúAbnormal‚Äù.  
2. **Detection:**  
   - If ‚ÄúAbnormal‚Äù, runs a **YOLOv8** detector to localize regions of concern (e.g., nodules, opacity).  
3. **Visualization:**  
   - Generates **Grad-CAM heatmaps** for interpretability.
