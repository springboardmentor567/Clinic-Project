CliniScan:Lung-Abnormality Detection on Chest Xâ€‘rays using AI

An AI-powered system that can automatically detect and localize lung abnormalities from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The system aims to assist radiologists and healthcare providers by identifying key pathological findings such as opacities, consolidations, fibrosis, and masses, and optionally classifying related pulmonary conditions like pneumonia or tuberculosis. The solution will be trained on the VinDr-CXR dataset and optimized for clinical relevance, interpretability, and deployment readiness in real-world diagnostic settings.
