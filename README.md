## üìã Project Overview

CliniScan AI is a proof-of-concept platform designed to showcase the power of deep learning in medical imaging. The primary goal is to provide an intuitive tool that assists in the analysis of chest radiographs by identifying and localizing potential pathological findings.

**This tool is for educational and demonstration purposes only and is not a certified medical device intended for real-world diagnostic use.**

### Key Features:
- **Dual-Model Pipeline:** Utilizes a two-stage process, combining a high-level classifier with a specific object detector for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** A user-friendly application built with Streamlit that allows for easy image upload and interaction.
- **Model Interpretability:** Implements Grad-CAM to generate heatmaps, providing visual insight into the classification model's decision-making process.
- **Flexible Detection:** Allows users to switch between a general single-class detector and a more specific multi-class detector.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend & Web Framework:** Python, Streamlit
- **Object Detection:** PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv8
- **Classification:** TensorFlow, Keras (ResNet50)
- **Data Handling & Image Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow
- **Visualization:** Grad-CAM, Plotly (for future metric dashboards)
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub (with Git LFS for large model handling)

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository is organized into a professional, modular structure:
- **/app.py:** The main Streamlit application script.
- **/src/:** Contains helper modules, such as `utils.py` for visualization functions.
- **/models/:** Stores the final, trained model weights (`.pt` and `.h5` files).
- **/assets/:** Contains static assets like images for the UI and performance charts.
- **/scripts/:** Includes scripts for one-time tasks like training the models.
- **/.streamlit/config.toml:** Configuration file for the Streamlit theme.
- **/requirements.txt:** A list of all necessary Python packages for easy setup.
